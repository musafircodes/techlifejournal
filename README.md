# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* `Node JS` 
* `npm` or `yarn`

## Built With

* [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/) - framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.

```shell script
$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/techlifejournal.git
$ cd techlifejournal
```
* installing the packages
```shell script
$ npm install
```
* setup .env file 
```env 
URL=http://localhost:3000
BACKEND_URL = https://api-techlifejournal.herokuapp.com/api/
```
* start the webserver
```shell script 
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

```
You can now view the site in the browser.

  > next@0.1.0 dev
  > next dev
  ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
  info  - ready on http://localhost:3000
Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```
* open the website in your browser



## Contributing

If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.


### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `development` if it exists, else from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `development` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- If the maintainer requests further changes just push them to your branch. The pull request will be updated automatically.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
